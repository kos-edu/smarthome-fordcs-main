__Software Education with templates & examples!__


A Ford Charging Station is emulated for an educational software project, short "edu-emulation". 

The goal of edu-emulation projects is to show the application of software development and deployment practices in a semi real-life software project!

The project documentation is a important as the code itself, and the consistency between them!
